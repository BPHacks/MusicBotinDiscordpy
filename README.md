This repository contains all of the code required **NOTE** you may need to download other dependencies which will be mentioned below. This bot has many features such as playing songs in multiple servers and making a queue for songs. Still it's a basic music cog as music bots are very complicated and you need deeper knowledge about [Discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/) to add other features

## Setup

Follow the below instructions to setup this bot(I will be making a video soon)
